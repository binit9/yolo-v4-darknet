# yolo-v4-darknet

This repository is for setting up GPU environment on Google Colab notebook for training Yolo V4 on Darknet framework

Following are the steps to implement Yolo V4 Object Detection on our custom dataset:

 - Configure GPU environment on Google Colab
 - Install the Darknet YOLOv4 training environment
 - Download custom dataset for Yolo V4 and set up directories
 - Configure a custom Yolo V4 training config file for Darknet
 - Train Yolo V4 object detection model
 - Reload YOLOv4 trained weights and make inference on test dataset
